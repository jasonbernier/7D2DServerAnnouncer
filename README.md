# 7D2DServerAnnouncer
The 7DTD Server Announcer is a C# application that connects to a local 7 Days to Die server via telnet and periodically sends messages to all players using the "say" command. This application reads its configuration from `config.txt`, allowing customization of server connection details, message source, and message frequency.
